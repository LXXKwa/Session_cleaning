* Anomaly detection
1. Data preparation:
    
    For session milk yield records:
    Input variable: Cow ID; parity; Days in milk (DIM); Milk in morning session (kg); Milk in afternoon session (kg); Milk in evening session (kg)
    Colnames: ID/Parity/DIM/milk1/milk2/milk3
    
    For daily milk yield records:
    Input variable: Cow ID; parity; Days in milk (DIM); Daily milk yield (kg)
    Colnames: ID/Parity/DIM/milk

2. The code is for session milk yields or daily milk yields recorded from 1-305d post-calving only, please see the manuscript for pre-quality control of the data.

3. Ensure that the ID in the first column is unique for each cow.

4. When session milk yield or daily milk yield is a missing value, mark it as NA.

5. Usage: anomaly_detection(data = data, session = 3, IQRn = 1.5, iforestn = 0.65, taun = 0.5)

6. Arguments:
    data: data to be detected (data frame)
    session: 1 = daily milk yield records; 3 = session milk yield records (default to 3);
    IQRn: the threshold in the IQR method, which defaults to 1.5 (range of values: >0; recommend: 1.3-1.8)
    iforestn: the threshold in the isolated forest, which defaults to 0.65 (range of values: 0-1; recommend: 0.55-0.65)
    taun: the quantile settings in quantile regression, which defaults to 0.5 (range of values: 0-1; recommend: 0.4-0.7)

7. Result: same format as input data.

8. Save your raw data in a safe space or have another copy!!!

* Imputation of missing data
1. Data preparation:
    
    For session milk yield records:
    Input variable: Cow ID; parity; Days in milk (DIM); Milk in morning session (kg); Milk in afternoon session (kg); Milk in evening session (kg)
    Colnames: ID/Parity/DIM/milk1/milk2/milk3
    
    For daily milk yield records:
    Input variable: Cow ID; parity; Days in milk (DIM); Daily milk yield (kg)
    Colnames: ID/Parity/DIM/milk
